## Use the web-interface to create a repository ##
(Master permissions are necessary for that in groups)
- Create a personal project in the swc group repository 
- pull - change - push cycle
- check back to the web-page to observe the changes.

## Conflicts and resolving conflicts ##
First we need to force a conflict 
- clone the publicrepository
- I will do a change on the local copy of the web-server and commit it.
- Please change the "Hello course" to something personal, like "greetings $YOURNAME" and commit it
- take a step back and consider the histories that have occured. We have 20 different histories by now.
- Should we be able to push?
- Try to push
- changes on the remote end
- pull the changes
- Merge conflict markers
- resolve the conflict by removing the merge markers
- commit the changes.
### Small Game ###
Try to push your changes. If it fails try to pull and adapt to the changes until you can succesfully 
push your changes. 
:-)

- Review the merge graph after the changes and the history in the web interface.

## branches and forks##

Fork the publicexample.
Exercise for home: try to store the names in a python data structure and iterate over that...
